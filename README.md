Hi there! I'm Mohamed, a front-end developer with expertise in React.js, TypeScript, and Nextjs

I have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a strong foundation in React.js and Next.js. I've developed the skills necessary to take on any challenge.

I'm always looking to improve my craft and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in web development. I love collaborating with other developers and designers, and I believe that the best solutions come from working together as a team. In addition to my technical skills, I'm a problem-solver with excellent communication skills.
